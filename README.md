This repository contains code and submission material for CMPE 255

Project Description:
I have made a translation app, using the Tkintr framework in Python and OpenAI API. You can input any sentence in English and have it translated into French or Spanish. The main project code was generated via GPT-Engineer and all the augmentation and testing was done via GitHub CoPilot.

Folder Structure
1. screencasts: contains all the screen recordings associated with GitHub CoPilot.
2. translator: contains all the Python code. The code generated by GPT-Engineer is present inside the workspace folder.

Inside translator>workspace
            1.README.md : generated by GPT-Engineer
            2. all_output.txt : the transcript of the conversation with GPT-Engineer

To run the application:
1. Need to have Python >= 3.10
2. Have OPENAI_API_KEY configured in environment variable
3. Run the file  translator>workspace>run.sh
