The application will be built using Python and the Tkinter library for the GUI. The OpenAI API will be used for the translation service. The application will follow the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture and SOLID principles.

The core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary are:

1. `TranslatorModel`: This class will be responsible for handling the translation logic. It will have a method `translate_text` that will use the OpenAI API to translate the input text from English to French.

2. `TranslatorView`: This class will be responsible for the GUI of the application. It will have methods to create the input and output text boxes and to update the output text box with the translated text.

3. `TranslatorController`: This class will be responsible for handling the user interactions. It will have methods to handle the 'Enter' key press event to translate the text and the 'Ctrl+Z' key press event to undo the last translation.

4. `main`: This function will be the entry point of the application. It will create instances of the `TranslatorModel`, `TranslatorView`, and `TranslatorController` classes and start the Tkinter event loop.

Now, let's write the code for each file.
